    <p> A lamp lit the platform, but the children's faces remained in a shadow. One of them asked me: <i>"Are you going to Dr. Stephen Albert's house?"</i> Without waiting for my answer, another said: <i>"The house is a good distance away but you won't get lost if you take the road to the left and bear to the left at every crossroad."</i> I threw them a coin (my last), went down some stone steps and started along a deserted road. At a slight incline, the road ran downhill. It was a plain dirt way, and overhead the branches of trees intermingled, while a round moon hung low in the sky as if to keep me company. </p>

    <p> For a moment I thought that Richard Madden might in some way have <u><i>divined my desperate intent</i></u>. At once I realized that this would be impossible. The advice about turning always to the left reminded me that such was the common formula for finding the central courtyard of certain labyrinths. I know something about labyrinths. Not for nothing am I the greatgrandson of Ts'ui Pen. He was Governor of Yunnan and gave up temporal power to write a novel with more characters than there are in the Hung Lou Meng, and to <u><i>create a maze in which all men would lose themselves</i></u>. He spent thirteen years on these oddly assorted tasks before he was <u><i>assassinated by a stranger</i></u>. His novel had no sense to it and nobody ever found his labyrinth. </p>

    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p>Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth. I imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain; I imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea; <u><i>I imagined it infinite</i></u>, made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers, provinces and kingdoms ... I thought of a maze of mazes, of <u><i>a sinuous, ever growing maze which would take in both past and future</i></u>  and would somehow involve the stars. </p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><u><i>Lost in these imaginary illusions I forgot my destiny</i></u> - that of the hunted. For an undetermined period of time I felt myself cut off from the world, an abstract spectator. The hazy and murmuring countryside, the moon, the decline of the evening, stirred within me. Going down the gently sloping road I could not feel fatigue. The evening was at once intimate and infinite. </p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p>The road kept descending and branching off, through meadows misty in the twilight. A high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept coming and going, moving with the breeze, blurred by the leaves and by distance.</p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p>I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words, gardens, streams, or the West wind. </p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p>Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could see an avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion. Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible: the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. The stuttering sparks of the music kept on. </p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p>But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, <u><i>a lantern approached;</i></u> a lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by the trunks of the trees; <u><i>a paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the moon.</i></u> A tall man carried it. I could not see his face for the light blinded me. </p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p> He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language.</p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><i>"I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude. No doubt you want to see the garden?"</i> </p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p> Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback. </p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><i>"The garden?"</i> </p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><i>"The garden of forking paths."</i> </p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p>Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance: </p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><i>"The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen."</i> </p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><pre>   </pre></p>
    <p><i>"Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? <b>Come in."</b></i></p>
